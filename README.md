Your path to a Open Source Computer Science Degree
</em>
</p>

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Princeton that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate Computer Science degree, minus general education.

## Summary

The OSU curriculum is a **complete education in computer science** using online materials initially based on the OSSU, MIT OCW and OSCS syllabi. As per the OSSU's mandate, <em>"The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc."</em> The aim being to take the best elements of these open source courses in order to provide the framework for a comprehensive 4-year undergraduate Computer Science Degree syllabus. 
<br><br>Please note, this syllabus is largely forked from the OSSU and Forrest Knight OSCS syllabuses. I've taken what I consider to be the best elements of both and have added other courses from the MIT OCW courselist in alignment with my own interests i.e. I've added extra modules from the MIT OCW, pertinent to how I want to shape my own syllabus etc.  <br><br>I've also looked at the [6-3 MIT catalog](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/) and the general MIT OCW [course list](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-number/) and also this [list](http://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/6/) in order to put together a curriculum that reflects my interests and educational needs (hence a lot of the graduate courses towards the end of the syllabus). <br><br>One way to appraoch this OSU Computer Science Degree syllabus, which I highly recommend, is to do what I have done and use an existing open source syllabus (or that of the OSSU or OSCS) that satisfies the demands of a full degree, and create your own Open Source Degree Syllabus and tailor it to your own needs!
Refer to [Course Info](./COURSEINFO.md) for general details on what is involved in the syllabus.

## Advanced CS


After completing **every required course** in Core CS, students should choose a subset of courses from Advanced CS based on interest.
Not every course from a subcategory needs to be taken.
But students should take *every* course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into.

The Advanced CS study should then end with one of the Specializations under [Advanced applications](#advanced-applications).
A Specialization's Capstone, if taken, may act as the [Final project](#final-project), if permitted by the Honor Code of the course.
If not, or if a student chooses not to take the Capstone, then a separate Final project will need to be done to complete this curriculum.

## Pro CS

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science, or quite close to one.
You can stop in the Advanced CS section, but the next step to completing your studies is to develop skills and knowledge in a specific domain.
Many of these courses are graduate-level.

Choose one or more of the following **specializations**:
- [Mastering Software Development in R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/r) by Johns Hopkins University
- [Artificial Intelligence Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/ai) by IBM, Amazon, and Didi
- [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) by kaggle
