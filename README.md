Your path to a Open Source Computer Science Degree
</em>
</p>

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Princeton that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate Computer Science degree, minus general education.

## Summary

The OSU curriculum is a **complete education in computer science** using online materials initially based on the OSSU, MIT OCW and OSCS syllabi. As per the OSSU's mandate, <em>"The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc."</em> The aim being to take the best elements of these open source courses in order to provide the framework for a comprehensive 4-year undergraduate Computer Science Degree syllabus.
<br><br>Please note, this syllabus is initially forked from the OSSU and Forrest Knight OSCS syllabuses. I've taken what I consider to be the best elements of both and have added other courses from the MIT OCW courselist in alignment with my own interests e.g I replaced the Duke/ San Diego Java courses with MIT courses in Java, C and C++, based on my own interests. (Please note git commit messages for things I have changed and updated - at the moment I'm tweaking courses as I go through the syllabus i.e. I add new courses or swap courses if I feel there is a better or pertinent version of a course eg swapping out University of San Diego's course on computer graphics for MIT's course or adding extra game development courses from MIT (including OCW notes as well as the lecture video's usually linked to both MIT OCW site and Youtube)). <br><br> After having sampled a good chunk of the courses from the afore-mentioned institutions, I ascertained that the content and structure of the MIT courses were the best fit for my educational needs. This was time consuming in the short-run but overall makes sure my time and effort is directed properly. <br><br>As such, these following courses/ modules are pertinent to how I want to shape my own syllabus. For example, I am particularly interested in AI, neuroscience, computational biology and mathematics in relation to the study of computer science. Where applicable, the MIT courses are done via edx etc, but please note that not all courses are certificate eligible (as they are sourced from the MIT OCW  directory directly). <br><br>I've also looked at the [6-3 MIT catalog](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/) and the general MIT OCW [course list](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-number/) and also this [list](http://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/6/) in order to put together a curriculum that reflects my interests and educational needs (hence a lot of the graduate courses towards the end of the syllabus). <br><br>One way to appraoch this OSU Computer Science Degree syllabus, which I highly recommend, is to do what I have done and use an existing open source syllabus (or that of the OSSU or OSCS) that satisfies the demands of a full degree, and create your own Open Source Degree Syllabus and tailor it to your own needs!

**<sup>1</sup> Note**:
These courses assume knowledge of basic physics.
([Why?](FAQ.md#why-is-the-curriculum-missing-some-pre-requisites))
If you are struggling, you can find a physics MOOC or utilize the materials from Khan Academy:
[Khan Academy - Physics](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics)


<sup>**1**</sup>: Students struggling with MIT Math for CS can consider taking the [Discrete Mathematics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics) first.
It is more interactive but less comprehensive, and it costs money to unlock full interactivity.

## Advanced CS

After completing **every required course** in Core CS, students should choose a subset of courses from Advanced CS based on interest.
Not every course from a subcategory needs to be taken.
But students should take *every* course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into.

The Advanced CS study should then end with one of the Specializations under [Advanced applications](#advanced-applications).
A Specialization's Capstone, if taken, may act as the [Final project](#final-project), if permitted by the Honor Code of the course.
If not, or if a student chooses not to take the Capstone, then a separate Final project will need to be done to complete this curriculum.

### Advanced programming

**Topics covered**:
`debugging theory and practice`
`goal-oriented programming`
`GPU programming`
`CUDA`
`parallel computing`
`object-oriented analysis and design`
`UML`
`large-scale software architecture and design`
`and more`

## Specializations

These Coursera Specializations all end with a Capstone project.
Depending on the course, you may be able to utilize the Capstone as your Final Project for this Computer Science curriculum.
Note that doing a Specialization with the Capstone at the end always costs money.
So if you don't wish to spend money or use the Capstone as your Final, it may be possible to take the courses in the Specialization for free by manually searching for them, but not all allow this.
